# Jbots
A Python Secure C2 server that interacts with bots launched, has a small amount of commands but is easy to add more

Jbots is not a unethical botnet used for DDOS attacks on servers, It is an experimental botnet that uses a C2 Server to interact with and command, has unharmful commands and code to servers or services.

Jbots is not a great option if u are using it for something complex or anything above, its writen in Python which is slow as hell, its not secure meaning its easy to boot off, the code is not optimal for using to for large tast, its simply experimental and its for learning, soon Jbots will be a bigger thing is a better language and with a better team.

Aperium, 2024 Soon
