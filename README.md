# Jbots
A Python Secure C2 server that interacts with bots launched, has a small amount of commands but is easy to add more.

Jbots is not a unethical botnet used for DDOS attacks on servers, It is an experimental botnet that uses a C2 Server to interact with and command, has unharmful commands and code to servers or services.

Jbots is not a great option if u are using it for something complex or anything above, its writen in Python which is slow as hell, its not secure meaning its easy to boot off, the code is not optimal for using to for large tast, its simply experimental and its for learning, soon Jbots will be a bigger thing is a better language and with a better team.

Aperium, 2024 Soon


# WARNING THIS CODE IS NOT TESTED WARNING
please make a issue in github about the issue and it will be fixed, Thank you.

# Creating Commands
creating commands are easy, first configure the command u want in the C2S server, then in the Connection Part or the Bots u code the actual Command and its Logic, Seems Easy right ??

# DO NOT USE FOR UNETHICAL REASONS OR ACTIONS
this code first of all isnt made or configured for unethical actions or DDOSING or similar, There bots can be turned off if the attacker knowns and has the right tools, dont do stupid shit.
